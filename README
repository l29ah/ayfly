How-to compile program:

wxWidgets is required to build the program. Tested with version 3.0.2.
For Linux SDL library is also required.

AYfly use standard automake tools. You can build it:

For Linux: autoreconf && ./configure && make && make install
For Windows(mingw32): autoreconf && ./configure mingw32 && make && make install

s60 directory is for symbian 9 build.

* When (cross-)compiling ayfly with mingw you need mingw-g++, mingw-gcc, wxWidgets library and friends in your PATH.
* DirectX libraties are required. You should copy headers in /path/to/directx/include and libs in /path/to/directx/lib. Default path is /opt/directx
